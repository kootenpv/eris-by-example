Low-Level Example
-----------------

The `example.sh` is an executable tutorial demonstrating how the pieces of the tendermint/mint-client stack fit together at the lowest level, using curl requests.

Run `example.sh` to try the example. Note it will attempt to install all the tools.

If the tools are already installed, use `NO_INSTALL=true bash example.sh`.

Clean up before subsequent calls by running `kill.sh`.

The script works on a MacOsX Mountain Lion, and requires some modifications to work on Linux.
